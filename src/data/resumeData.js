  summary: `I discovered my passion for programming at the age of 15, learning Python. Now at 23, I developed a strong foundation in Java and Python throughout my studies. I have a diverse professional exposure as both a data scientist as a full-stack web developer. As a CSM I am comfortable working in a fast-paced agile enviornment. I have almost 2 years of experience developing microservices and managing the software development lifecycle. My technical passion lies in automating and streamlining processes while working alongside a strong team. I'm at my best when I'm collaborating with a team—communicating clearly, developing efficient solutions, and crafting meaningful experiences for end users.`,
